<h2 id="81-define-patient-privacy">8.1 Define patient privacy.</h2>
<p><strong>Patient privacy</strong> refers to the right of individuals to have their personal health information protected and kept confidential. It ensures that a patient's medical history, treatment plans, diagnoses, and any other sensitive health-related data are not disclosed to unauthorized individuals or entities. Patient privacy is a fundamental aspect of healthcare ethics and legal regulations, designed to build trust between patients and healthcare providers. </p>
<p>Key aspects of patient privacy include:
1. <strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensuring that health information is shared only with individuals involved in the patient's care or with others when legally permitted (such as with the patient’s consent or in cases of public health concerns).
2. <strong>Data Protection</strong>: Safeguarding electronic and physical records to prevent unauthorized access, breaches, or theft.
3. <strong>Control Over Information</strong>: Allowing patients to control who can access or share their health information and giving them the right to review their records.
4. <strong>Legal Frameworks</strong>: Many countries have laws like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S., which establishes standards to protect patient information.</p>
<p>Maintaining patient privacy is crucial to maintaining trust, ensuring proper care, and preventing misuse of sensitive information.</p>

<p>To <strong>correct a written report</strong> properly, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Strike Through the Error</strong>: Instead of erasing or using correction fluid, draw a single line through the error so that it remains legible. This maintains transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial and Date</strong>: Write your initials and the date next to the correction to indicate when and who made the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write the Correct Information</strong>: Clearly provide the corrected information next to the strikethrough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Backdating</strong>: Ensure that any corrections reflect the actual time and date when the change was made, rather than attempting to alter the original timeline.</p>
